Magnolia Shohp Module

This module provides simple shopping cart functionallity.

After successful installation (see INSTALLATION.txt) you should end up with a "sampleShop" page in your website tree, "sampleShop" folder in the DMS tree and a "sampleShop" folder in the data tree (see JCR data browser). You can open the "sampleShop" page and test the shop by adding products to the shopping cart and proceeding to the checkout. If you configure the SMTP settings correctly first (See "Configuration" > "Mail (SMTP)") you will even get a confirmation mail when completing the order.
